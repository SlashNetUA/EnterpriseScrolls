# REDIRECT

`REDIRECT FROM £chan TO £chan`

Reads input from the first channel and directs it to the second, until the end of a file is reached, the 'Stop' key is pressed, or there is an error from one of the channels. The redirection can also be halted by use of the invalid channel number **£255** as the **TO** channel in a later **REDIRECT** statement.
