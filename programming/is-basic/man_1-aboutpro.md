# ABOUT PROGRAMMING

You've now had some fun with the machine and, hopefully, introduced yourself. You probably didn't see how some of the-programs worked, so this is where we begin adding knowledge to enjoyment.

You've already learned in brief what a program is, but there is a little more to writing it than just giving instructions. You can think of a program as a way to solve a problem using a computer. A computer is either a tool which can expand and speed up your brain power, or it is a pleasurable thing to own on which you can play games or invent some for yourself.

All computers understand instructions, usually in the form of words or lists of numbers. We will be using words to communicate with the Enterprise. Each word is a small instruction; you can put them together like a puzzle or a story to make up bigger instructions and, eventually, complete tasks. That is what programming is essentially about. Giving the computer instructions— in the order in which you want them to happen.

The diagram below shows (using an everyday example) how one task must be broken up into several small ones to make up a program.

## COMPUTER LANGUAGES

Now you know what a program is, let's move on a stage further. Just as there are many different ways to talk to another person, so there are many ways to program a computer. And in the same way that there are human languages, there are computer languages.

Languages are made up with definite limits and types of task in mind. Some are especially for programs involving long lists of things, others are particularly good at making pictures with a computer. Others still are there to teach people how to program.

## BASIC

The language you are learning through this manual is known as BASIC. It uses words with similar spelling and meaning to English words. It is therefore very easy to learn and understand, even if you are inexperienced with computers. All the programs in this manual are in BASIC, and it is the language the computer understands as long as the IS-BASIC cartridge is plugged in. Remember that, from now on, all the instructions and all the information in this manual relate to BASIC. Some other languages are totally different in both philosophy and approach, and they usually look completely different from BASIC.

Look at this:
```
10 PRINT "Hello!"
```
You will know by now that it's a program line – it's one small task which could make up part of a bigger one. Just as, in a story, each sentence tells you something, so each line in a program tells the computer to do something. If you want to tell the computer to carry out a task, you will need several lines to do it.
