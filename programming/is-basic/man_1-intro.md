# INTRODUCTION

Let's begin by using the machine. That way you can get used to it and see demonstrations of its abilities. Technicalities will be explained later.

It is best if you follow this part of the manual in sequential order, because it is designed to help you to get acquainted with your new computer. Wherever there is scope for you to follow up one subject before you go on to look at others, cross references are provided, so you can learn about the machine in whatever order and at whatever speed you feel comfortable. The second part covers each 'section' of programming (they all link up in reality as you will see) in detail and on a slightly higher level than in the first part. The Reference Section at the end will help you to discover more about the Enterprise once you have learned the fundamentals of controlling the computer.

Before you look at some programs, experiment with the keyboard a bit. You can type whatever you like and it won't hurt the computer at all. If the computer stops producing letters in response to your typing, just press the 'reset' button at the back. The joystick is really good to mess about withâ€”and you'll see how handy it is later on. In the meantime let yourself get to know the computer. It's got a lot to offer you.

*Note: When you are just using the computer for [word processing](man_1-wordproc.md) (see pages 38-42 and the tables on pages 36 and 37), you don't need to insert the IS-BASIC cartridge. In order to write BASIC programs, however, you need to have this cartridge plugged into the ROM BAY on the left-hand side of the machine.*
