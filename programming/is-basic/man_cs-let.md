# LET

`LET variable-list=expression`

Simple assignment; **LET** is optional unless the variable name is the same as a keyword. Listing or saving the program causes the **LET** to be inserted so that the program conforms to the standard. Can be executed in immediate mode.

One value can be assigned to several variables:

`LET A,B(4),C=0`  
`A_VAR=A_VAR+1`  
`A$,FRED$='He said"&"Don't"&". "&FRED$(I:J)`  
`LET INPUT=3`
