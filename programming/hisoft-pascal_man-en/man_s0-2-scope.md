# 0.2 SCOPE OF THIS MANUAL

This manual is not intended to teach you Pascal; you are referred to the excellent books given in the Bibliography if you are a newcomer to programming in Pascal.

This manual is a reference document, detailing the particular features of HiSoft Pascal.

[Section 1](man_s1-0-index.md) gives the syntax and the semantics expected by the compiler.

[Section 2](man_s2-0-index.md) details the various predefined identifiers that are available within HiSoft Pascal, from CONSTants to FUNCTIONS.

[Section 3](man_s3-0-index.md) contains information on the various compiler options available and also on the format of comments.

[Section 4](man_s4-int-editor.md) describes the integral editor used to create, amend and save your Pascal programs.

[Section 5](man_s5-turtle.md) describes the Turtle Graphics package supplied with the Pascal on the reverse side of the tape.

The above Sections should be read carefully by all users.

[Appendix 1](man_a1-errors.md) details the error messages generated both by the compiler and the runtimes.

[Appendix 2](man_a2-reserved-words.md) lists the predefined identifiers and reserved words.

[Appendix 3](man_a3-data-storage.md) gives details on the internal representation of data within HiSoft Pascal — useful for programmers who wish to get their hands dirty.

[Appendix 4](man_a4-examples.md) gives some example Pascal programs — study this if you experience any problems in writing HiSoft Pascal programs.
