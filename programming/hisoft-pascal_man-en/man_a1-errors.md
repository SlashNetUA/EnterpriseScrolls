## A.1.2 RUNTIME ERROR MESSAGES

When a runtime error is detected then one of the following messages will be displayed, followed by '`at PC=XXXX`' where **XXXX** is the memory location at which the error occurred. Consult the compilation listing to see where in the program the error occurred, using **XXXX** to cross reference.

|Number|Description|
|:----:|:----------|
|1|Halt
|2|Overflow
|3|Out of RAM
|4|/ by zero (*also generated by DIV*).
|5|Index too low
|6|Index too high
|7|Maths Call Error
|8|Number too large
|9|Number expected
|10|Line too long
|11|Exponent expected

Runtime errors result in the program execution being halted.
