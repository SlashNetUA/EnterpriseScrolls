# NET:

`NET:`  
`NETn:`  
`NET-n:`  

Built-in local net. The number **n** is the network address (in the range **1**-**32**) of the machine with which communications are being established. If **n** is **0**, this defines a "general" channel — used for broadcasting to all machines, and for receiving data without specifying the source machine.
