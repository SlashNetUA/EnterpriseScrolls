# 2.4.5.11 RANSEED(X,Y,Z)

This procedure has three INTEGER parameters which are used as seeds for the random numbers produced by [RANDOM](man_s2-4-6-random.md). These integers must be between **1** and **30000**.

In order to use the same random numbers for different runs of a program you should use this procedure.
