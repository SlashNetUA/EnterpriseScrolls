# 2.4.5.6 HALT

This procedure causes program execution to stop with the message '`Halt at PC=XXXX`' where **XXXX** is the hexadecimal memory address of the location where the **HALT** was issued. Together with a compilation listing, **HALT** may be used to determine which of two or more paths through a program are taken. This will normally be used during debugging.
