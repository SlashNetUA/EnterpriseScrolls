# NET NUMBER

`ASK NET NUMBER var`  
`SET NET NUMBER expr`

Sets up the computer's network address number. This must be in the range **1** to **32**. This starts up as **0**, which is not valid as a network address.

A net number must be specified before using the network, and should not be the same value as set by any other computer on the network.
