# RND

Generates a random number between **0** and **1**. For practical use, random numbers are multiplied and made into bigger numbers. **INT(RND\*100)** would give a whole (integer) random number between **0** and **99** inclusive. (**RND** is never **1**.)

# RND(X)

Generates an integer random number less than **X**. The largest allowable value for **X** is **32767**.
