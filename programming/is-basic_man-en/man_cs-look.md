# LOOK

`LOOK Â£chan AT x,y:v`

Assigns to variable '**v**' the palette colour at point (**x**,**y**) on the standard graphics page or other page specified by the channel expression. Both the channel expression and the **AT** part are optional. If the **AT** part is omitted, the current beam (cursor) position will be used. Note that the use of **AT** will turn off the beam and move it to (**x**,**y**).

## Bugs
