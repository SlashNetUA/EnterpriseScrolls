# EDIT

`EDIT program-number`  
`EDIT "name"`

Makes the specified program into the current one, so that [LIST](man_cs-list.md), [RENUMBER](man_cs-renumber.md), [RUN](man_cs-run.md) etc. will operate on it. Only works in immediate mode. See [CHAIN](man_cs-chain.md), [INFO](man_cs-info.md) and [PROGRAM](man_cs-program.md).
