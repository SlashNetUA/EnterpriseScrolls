# ORD(A$)
 
Gives the ASCII code for the character in quotes, or the ASCII code of the first character of a string variable. **ORD** stands for ordinal, and means the number associated with the character, in the character-set used by the computer. Since the Enterprise uses ASCII, the ASCII value is returned.
