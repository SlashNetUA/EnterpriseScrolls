# Chapter 2: Choosing Your Disk Drives

The Enterprise disk interface is "**Shugart 410**" compatible and can be used with most of the modern **5.25”** and **3.5”** drives. Appendices A and B at the back of this manual give a detailed description of the disk drive connecting socket, and specify the characteristics of drives compatible with the Enterprise.

It is also possible to connect certain types of **3”** drive, although some modification to the connections may be required. Enterprise will not be supporting the **3”** format when releasing disk based programs. It is not possible to use "dedicated" drives such as those designed for the CBM 64 or the Atari 800 series. The larger, **8”** drives are also unsuitable.

Any drive considered for use with your Enterprise should ideally have its own power supply, as the Enterprise has no facility for powering drives. Alternatively a separate power supply could be used (see Appendix B).

As was mentioned in the introduction, the Enterprise can handle up to four drives and these can be a mixture of **40** or **80 track**, **double-** or **single sided**, **3.5”** or **5.25”**. Your own choice of drive may be made on one or more factors including price, availability and the use to which your computer will be put. Disk based programs from Enterprise will be generally available only on the **3.5”** format, although **5.25”** program disks will be available by special request directly from Enterprise or their overseas distributors.

The amount of storage available varies from approx. **180K** for a single sided 40 track drive up to approx. **720K** for a double sided 80 track drive. Double sided drives are treated as one, larger capacity drive.

A system with **80** track drives can read and write to **40** track disks and double sided drives can access single sided disks. Obviously it is not possible to use **80** track formatted disks with a **40** track drive or a disk formatted as double sided on a single sided drive.

Maximum flexibility will be obtained if double sided, **80** track drives are used. Disk software produced by Enterprise will be available on **40** track, single sided disks and so be readable on all combinations of drive.

The two sizes of disk, **3.5”** and **5.25”**, offer identical storage capacity for the same configuration. The smaller **3.5”** disks are more robust, as they feature a hard protective casing, and they are also easier to carry as two or three can fit into a shirt pocket. Currently the cost of **3.5”** disks is higher than that of an equivalent **5.25”** disk, although the **3.5”** drives themselves are cheaper.

As mentioned previously, programs will only be generally available on the **3.5”** format. The choice of drive size and format however, may be dictated by other considerations. EXDOS is MS-DOS "file compatible" and so can read and write disks produced on other computers. These computers include the IBM PC and compatibles (which mostly use **5.25”** drives) and the Apricot range, RM Nimbus, Atari 520ST and the MSX machines (all of which use **3.5”**). If data portability is important to you, it is essential to choose drives that can handle the size and format of the disks from the other computer.

Maximum flexibility for the interchange of data with other computers could be achieved by having one **3.5”** drive and one **5.25”**, both of which were double sided, **80** track. This combination would even allow data to be transferred from an IBM PC to an Apricot or vice versa via the Enterprise while still maintaining access to the generally available Enterprise programs.

It should be stressed that we are talking about transferring data to and from these computers, NOT running programs from them.

Although twin drives will make your system more efficient, many of the advantages of a disk system can be obtained with a single disk drive. EXDOS features an automatic MAPDISK mode which prompts a single drive user to change disks when required. This is more fully explained in Appendix C at the back of this manual.
