# Chapter 1: Introduction

The addition of an Enterprise Disk Interface and disk drives to your Enterprise system will open up a whole new area of computing experience. Your favorite games will load in seconds instead of minutes, you will be able to read data files from other computers and, using the [IS-DOS](../../software/ss-is-dos.md) disk, you will be able to run software designed to run under CP/M.

The Enterprise disk operating system is called **EXDOS** (**E**nterprise e**X**pandable **DOS**) and is both powerful and user friendly. It will resemble MS-DOS to the user familiar with this operating system, while those familiar with the standard Enterprise will find that commands for the use of tape, such as [LOAD](../is-basic-man-en/commands/man_cs-load.md) and [SAVE](../is-basic-man-en/commands/man_cs-save.md), operate in an almost identical way when using disks.

Up to **four** drives can be connected to your Enterprise and these can be a mix of **3.5”** or **5.25”**, **40** or **80 track** and **single** or **double sided**. During operation, EXDOS performs checks on the drives to determine the number and type of drives present.

Please read the relevant chapters in this manual carefully BEFORE attempting to connect your system.
