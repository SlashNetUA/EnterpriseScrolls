# Chapter 3: What is a Floppy Disk?

A floppy disk, like cassette tape, uses a magnetic oxide coating as a storage medium. The tape cassette is a "serial storage" device which requires "winding on" to the appropriate place on the tape before data can be accessed. This procedure can be hit and miss due to the uncertain nature of the tape counters on cassette decks and the length of tape involved. It is also very time consuming due to the slow tape loading speeds.

On a floppy disk, the data is usually held radially in tracks across the surface of the disk, with each track divided into a number of sectors. An indication of how the tracks and sectors are layed out on a disk is shown in Diagram 3.

When a new disk is purchased it is totally blank, and does not contain the divisions into tracks and sectors. Before it can be used, it must be FORMATted — this creates the magnetic "reference marks" which divide the disk into tracks and sectors. Instructions on how to FORMAT your disks are given later in this manual.

As we have previously mentioned there are several sizes of floppy disks available. We will only concern ourselves with the **3.5”** and **5.25”** types. The main features of each type of disk are shown in Diagrams 1 and 2.

## Care of disks

In order to keep programs and data safe, certain precautions must be taken when handling floppy disks. Here is a list of do's and don't's:

 - Do not place the disks close to sources of magnetic radiation, these include magnets, monitors, TV's, radios, speakers, tape recorders, telephones and electric motors.

 - Always store in a cool, dry, dust free place.

 - Do not touch magnetic surfaces, always store **5.25”** disks in their envelopes. Do not slide the protective shutter back on **3.5”** disks.

 - Only write on the labels of **5.25”** disks with felt tip pens. Do not bend or fold disks.

 - Always keep a back-up copy of important data on a separate disk.

 - Do not insert or remove disks from a drive when they being accessed by the system. Insert disks carefully.

 - Do not power down the drives or the computer during a disk operation.

Disks may be "write protected", to stop any data being written to the disk or any files being deleted. Figures 4 and 5 show how disks may be write protected. Files may also be made "read only" by using the ATTRibute command under IS-DOS. See your IS-DOS manual for further details.
