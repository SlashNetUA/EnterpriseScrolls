## Results

Does not return

## Description

This function call is equivalent to a '**JMP 0000h**'. It will return control to the IS-DOS command interpreter, which will be reloaded from disk if necessary. A zero error code will be returned to IS-DOS unless the user's abort routine has been called (see [function 81h](f81h.md)).
