# Function 22h: Random Write

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to opened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** = 
 - **00h**: if no error
 - **01h**: if error (disk full)

## Description

This function writes a **128-byte** record from the current disk transfer address to the file, at the record position specified by the three-byte random record number (bytes **21h**...**23h**). All three bytes of the random record number are used. If the record position is beyond the current end of file, then uninitialized disk space will be allocated to fill the gap.

The random record number field will not be changed, but the current record and extent fields will be set up to refer to the same record. The record count byte will be adjusted as necessary if the file is being extended or if the write goes into a new extent.
