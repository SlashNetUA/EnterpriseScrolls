# Function 30h: Absolute Sector Write

## Parameters

**DE** = Sector number  
**L** = Drive number (**1**=**A:** etc)  
**H** = Number of sectors to write  

## Results

**A** = EXOS error code  
**DE** = Next sector number  
**H** = Number of sectors written  

## Description

This function writes sectors directly to the disk without interpreting them as files. The disk must be a valid DOS disk in order for the sector number to be translated into a physical position on the disk. Details of disk layout etc can be found in the separate EXDOS documentation.
