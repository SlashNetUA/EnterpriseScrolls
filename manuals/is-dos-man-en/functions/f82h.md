# Function 82h: Allocate Segment

## Parameters

None

## Results

**A** = EXOS error code  
**C** = Segment number  

## Description

This is identical in function to the EXOS allocate segment call, and will allocate a user segment. However, IS-DOS remembers the segment numbers of any segments allocated with this function, and is thus able to free them when the program terminates. This relieves the program from the responsibility of freeing any allocated segments and more importantly ensures that segments will be freed even if the program is terminated by a warm reset. A maximum of **32** segments can be allocated by this function.
