# Function 15h: Sequential Write

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to opened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** =
 - **00h**: if write was successful
 - **01h**: if error (disk full)

## Description

This function writes the **128 bytes** from the current disk transfer address to the file at the position defined by the current record and extent, which are then incremented appropriately. The record count byte is kept updated correctly if the file is extended or if the write moves into a new extent. The file size in the FCB is also updated if the file is extended.

In CP/M and MSX-DOS, the error return (**A**=**01h**) is defined always to mean "disk full". IS-DOS may return this error for various other reasons, but generally a program will not go too far wrong if it assumes that this error does mean disk full.
