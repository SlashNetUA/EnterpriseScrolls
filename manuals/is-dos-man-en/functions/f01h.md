# Function 01h: Console Input

## Parameters

None

## Results

**L**=**A** = Character from keyboard

## Description

A character will be read from the keyboard and echoed to the screen. If no character is ready then this function will wait for one. The characters '**Ctrl-S**', '**Ctrl-P**' and '**Ctrl-C**' will be intercepted to provide the normal CP/M control functions (pause, printer on/off and reboot) and will not be returned to the transient program. '**Ctrl-C**' will give a prompt to the user before rebooting to allow him to change his mind.
