# Function 17h: Rename File

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to modified unopened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** =
 - **00h**: if successful
 - **FFh**: if unsuccessful

## Description

The modified unopened FCB has the normal drive and filename, and also a second filename starting at (**DE+17**). Every file in the current directory of the specified drive which matches the first filename is changed to the second filename - with `?` characters in the second filename leaving the appropriate character unchanged. Checks are done to prevent duplicate or illegal filenames from being created. Entries for sub-directories and system files will not be renamed.
