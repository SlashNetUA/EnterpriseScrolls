# Function 14h: Sequential Read

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to opened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** =
 - **00h**: if read was successful
 - **01h**: if error (end of file)

## Description

This function reads the next sequential **128-byte** record from the file into the current disk transfer address. The record is defined by the current extent (high and low bytes) and the current record. After successfully reading the record, this function increments the current record and if it reaches **80h**, sets it back to zero and increments the extent number. The record count field is also kept updated when necessary.

In CP/M and MSX-DOS, the error return (**A**=**01h**) is defined always to mean end of file. In IS-DOS there are various other errors which could result in this error return, but generally the transient program will not go far wrong if it assumes that this error means end of file.

Sequential read operations are done through a **2k** buffer within IS-DOS in order to improve the speed of reading files. This is totally transparent to the transient program.

Unlike CP/M it is possible to have partially filled records, since the file size is not necessarily a multiple of **128 bytes**. If this occurs then the partial record is padded out with zeroes when it is copied to the transient program's DTA address.
