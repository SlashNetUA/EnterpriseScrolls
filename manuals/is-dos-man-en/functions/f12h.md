# Function 12h: Search for Next

## Parameters

None 

## Results

**L**=**A** =
 - **00h**: if file is found
 - **FFh**: if file not found

## Description

This function must only be done after a '[SEARCH FOR FIRST](f11h.md)' has been done. It continues the search to look for the next match with the filename. The results returned from this function are identical to '[SEARCH FOR FIRST](f11h.md)', and all the same comments apply. The information used to continue the search is held internally within IS-DOS, and so the original FCB used in the '[SEARCH FOR FIRST](f11h.md)' need not still exist.
