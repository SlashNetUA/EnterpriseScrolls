# Function 07h: Direct Console Input

## Parameters

None

## Results

**A**=**L** = Input character

## Description

This is the same as the input part of [function 06h](f06h.md) except that if no character is ready then it will wait for one. Like [function 06h](f06h.md) no echo or control character checks are done. This is provided for MSX-DOS compatibility; it is not available in CP/M, which uses this function number for "get I/O byte".
