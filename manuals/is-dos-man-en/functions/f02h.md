## Parameters

**E** = Character to be output

None

## Description

The character passed in register **E** is written to the screen. Tabs are expanded to columns of eight characters. If the printer is enabled then the character is also written to the printer. A console status check is done to test for '**Ctrl-P**', '**Ctrl-S**' and '**Ctrl-C**'. Certain control codes and escape sequences can be used to control the screen. These are described in section 5 and are based on the VT-52 standard.
