# Function 27h: Block Read

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to opened FCB  
**HL** = Number of records to read

## Results

**A** =
 - **00h**: if no error
 - **01h**: if error

## Description

This function is the complement of the '[BLOCK WRITE](f26h.md)' function, and most of the same comments apply as regards its use. Again, if large blocks are read, it will be much faster than the normal CP/M operation.

The number of records actually read is returned in **HL**. This may be smaller than the number of records requested if the end of the file was encountered. In this case any partial record will be padded out with zeroes before being copied to the user's DTA. The random record field is adjusted to the first record not read, ie the value returned in **HL** is added on to it.
