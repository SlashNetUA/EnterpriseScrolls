# Function 84h: Get Uncased Command Line

## Parameters

None

## Results

None

## Description

The command line passed to a transient program at **80h** will have been uppercased by IS-DOS to ensure CP/M compatibility. However same programs may want to have their parameters as typed by the user, for example a 'FIND' utility may want to search for an exact match to a lower-case string. This function call simply copies the original command line to the buffer at **80h**, without upper-casing. The resulting command line will be exactly the same as it was when the program was entered, except for any upper/lower case differences.
