# Function 10h: Close File

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to unopened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** =
 - **00h**: if successful
 - **FFh**: if not successful

## Description

The FCB must have previously been opened with either an [OPEN](f0fh.md) or a [CREATE](f16h.md) function call. If the file has only been read, then this function does nothing. If the file has been written to, then any buffered data will be written to disk and the directory entry updated appropriately. The file may still be accessed after a close, so the function can be regarded as doing an "ensure" operation.
