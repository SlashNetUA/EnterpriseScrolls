# PAUSE

## Format

`PAUSE [text]`

## Purpose

Prints text and prompts for a keypress in a batch file.

## Use

The text is printed to the screen.  If no text  is printed then just a blank line is output.

 The  prompt "**Press ENTER to continue...**"  is  then printed, and a line is input.  The joystick may then be used  for  scrolling the screen back and  forth  before **Enter** is pressed.

## Examples

`PAUSE Insert next disk in drive B:`  
_Insert next disk in drive B:_  
_Press ENTER to continue..._
