# General Rules

The parameters of a command must be separated from the command itself by at least one space or tab character (these two characters generally being treated as equivalent by the command interpreter). Where two filenames are required as parameters, they too must be separated by a space or tab. Options given after a filename (after a `/` character) need not be separated in this way.

Although this is not a command as such, the currently logged-on drive can be changed by giving the instruction:

```
d:
```

— which causes drive **d:** to become the currently logged-on drive, even if it does not actually exist.

In the command examples, underlined text is an example response to a command. Comments that are not part of the command are given in parentheses (`(` and `)`).
