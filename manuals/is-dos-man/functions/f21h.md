# Function 21h: Random Read

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to opened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** = 
 - **00h**: if read was successful
 - **01h**: if error (end of file)

## Description

This function reads a **128-byte** record from the file to the current disk transfer address, The file position is defined by the three-byte random record number in the FCB (bytes **21h**...**23h**). Unlike CP/M (but like MSX-DOS) all three bytes of the random record number are used. A partial record at the end of the file will be padded with zeroes before being copied to the user’s DTA.

The random record number is not altered, so successive calls to this function will read the same record unless the transient program alters the random record number. A side effect is that the current record and extent ere set up to refer to the same record as the random record number. This means that sequential reads (or writes) can follow a random read, and will start from the same record. The record count byte is also set up correctly for the extent.
