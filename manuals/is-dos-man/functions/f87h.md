# Function 87h: Get IS-DOS Version Number

## Parameters

None

## Results

**A** = CP/M version number  
**B** = EXDOS version number  
**C** = IS-DOS version number  

## Description

This function simply returns the three version numbers as indicated above. Each is returned as a two-digit BCD number, so the CP/M version number is always **22h**. This function can be used by a program to determine whether it is cunning under IS-DOS or CP/M, since CP/M will not return **22h** in register **A**.
