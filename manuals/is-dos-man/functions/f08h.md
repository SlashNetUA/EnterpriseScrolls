# Function 08h: Console Input (no echo)

## Parameters

None

## Results

**A**=**L** = Input character

## Description

This function is identical to [function 01h](f01h.md) except that the input character will not be echoed to the screen. The same control character checks will be done. This is provided for MSX-DOS compatibility; it is not present in CP/M, which uses this function number for "set I/O byte".
