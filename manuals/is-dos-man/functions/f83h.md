# Function 83h: Free Segment

## Parameters

**C** = Segment number to free

## Results

**A** = EXOS error code

## Description

This function is identical to the equivalent EXOS function call but it also deletes the specified segment number from IS-DOS's internal list of allocated segments. It is not necessary for a program to free segments, since this will be done automatically when IS-DOS re-boots, but it may be useful in some circumstances.
