# Function 80h: Terminate with Error Code

## Parameters

**B** = Error code for termination

## Results

Does not return

## Description

This function terminates the transient program and returns the specified error code to IS-DOS as the result of the program. A value of zero means success and any other value is an error. For all error codes in the range **20h**...**FFh**, IS-DOS will display an error message, while for values **01h**...**1Fh** no message will be displayed. Many useful error codes with associated messages are defined by EXOS and EXDOS (see separate documentation).

Note that if a user abort routine has been defined then this function will call the abort routine as if it had been called from the user program, and it must terminate with a normal '**JP 0**' exit. The error code is remembered internally and will be returned to IS-DOS. See '[DEFINE ABORT ROUTINE](f81h.md)' for more about the user abort routine.
