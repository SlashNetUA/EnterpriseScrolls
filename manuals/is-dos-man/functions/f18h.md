# Function 18h: Get Login Vector

## Parameters

None

## Results

**DE:HL** = Login vector

## Description

This function returns a bit set in **DE:HL** for each drive which is available, **bit-0** of **L** corresponding to drive '**A:**'. In CP/M and MSX-DOS, register **DE** is undefined since these systems have a maximum of **16** drives.

Note that IS-DOS cannot tell whether a particular drive is actually connected; it can only tell whether there is a unit handler for that drive, after translating the logical drive number to a physical one. This means that normally it will always claim to have drives **A**, **B**, **C**, **D** and **E** corresponding to the four possible floppy drives and the RAM-disk. If any [ASSIGN](../commands/cmd-assign.md) or [MAPDISK](../commands/cmd-mapdisk.md) commands have been done, this will affect which drives are available. If a bit for a particular drive is clear, then attempting to access that drive will produce an immediate error; whereas if the bit is set, then IS-DOS will try to access the drive and may then fail with an abort/retry message.
