# Function 23h: Get File Size

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to unopened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** = 
 - **00h**: if file found OK
 - **01h**: if file not found

## Description

This function searches for the first match with the filename in the FCB, exactly the same as '[OPEN FILE](f0fh.md)'. The size of the located file is rounded up to the nearest **128 bytes** and the number of records determined. The three-byte random record field of the FCB is set to the number of records, so it is the number of the first record which doesn't exist. The fourth byte of the random record number is not altered.
