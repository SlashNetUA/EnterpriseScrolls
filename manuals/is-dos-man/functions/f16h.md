# Function 16h: Create File

## Parameters

**DE** = Pointer to unopened FCB

## Results

**L**=**A** =
 - **00h**: if successful
 - **FFh**: if unsuccessful

## Description

This function creates a new file in the current directory of the specified drive and opens it ready for reading and writing. The drive, filename and low byte of the extent number must be set up in the FCB and the filename must not be ambiguous. Checks will be done to ensure that invalid filenames are not created.

If there is already a file of the required name, then the action depends on the value of the extent number byte. Normally this will be zero, and in this case the old file will be deleted and a new one created. However, if the extent number is non-zero then the existing file will be opened without creating a new file. This ensures compatibility with early versions of CP/M where each extent had to be explicitly created.

In all cases the resulting file will be opened with the required extent number exactly as if an '[OPEN](f0fh.md)' function call had been done.
